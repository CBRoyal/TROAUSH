            <p>U.S. Highways are integrated routes and highways numbered with a nationwide grid in 
               the contiguous U.S. They're sometimes called federal highways, as the designation and
               numbering of these highways were coordinated among the U.S., but the roadways were 
               built and are currently maintained by state or local governments since 1926. Unlike 
               later Interstate highways, U.S. highways don't have a minimum design standard, as 
               they're not usually built to freeway standards. Many are designed as main streets of
               certain cities and towns they run through and very few are designed as toll roads, 
               except they don't have any tool bridges or tunnels. This webpage takes you on a road
               trip down all of the facts about the U.S. highways in America.</p>
            <h2>Numbering System</h2>
            <img src="The Routes of America_U.S. Highways_files/US_20.png" alt="US-20 Sign" 
             width="200" height="200">
            <img src="The Routes of America_U.S. Highways_files/US_287.png" alt="US-287 Sign" 
             width="200" height="200">
            <p>Much like the Interstate highways, the U.S. highways follow a grid numbering pattern, 
               in which routes assigned odd-numbers run north-south and routes assigned even-numbers
               run east-west, though routes assigned three-digit numbers can be either-or. However, 
               some two-digit routes don't run in their general direction. Unlike the Interstate 
               Highway Numbering System, the U.S. Highway Numbering System assigns lower odd numbers
               in the east, higher odd numbers in the west, lower even numbers in the north, and 
               higher even numbers in the south. The one- and two-digit U.S. highways are major 
               routes, while three-digit U.S. highways are shorter spur routes from a main U.S. 
               highway and just like Interstate highways, not all of them run in the same direction
               as their parent U.S. highways.</p>
            <h2>Signage</h2>

             alt="Full Blank U.S. Highway Sign" width="200" height="200">
            <p>U.S. Highways are typically displayed as large black rectangles with white shields 
               displayed within them and their distinct route number displayed within the shield. 
               Individual states around America manufactures their own U.S. highway signs, as 
               they may use cut-out or rectangular designs, outline black outlines, and print the 
               letters "US" above the numerals. One- and two-digit numbered shields feature the same
               large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either 
               use the same shield with a narrow font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield. 
               Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a 
               letter suffixed to the route number.</p>
