            <p>U.S. Highways are integrated routes and highways numbered with a nationwide grid in 
               the contiguous U.S. They're sometimes called federal highways, as the designation and
               numbering of these highways were coordinated among the U.S., but the roadways were 
               built and are currently maintained by state or local governments since 1926. Unlike 
               later Interstate highways, U.S. highways don't have a minimum design standard, as 
               they're not usually built to freeway standards. Many are designed as main streets of
               certain cities and towns they run through and very few are designed as toll roads, 
               except they don't have any tool bridges or tunnels. This webpage takes you on a road
               trip down all of the facts about the U.S. highways in America.</p>
            <h2>Numbering System</h2>
            <section class="container d-flex" id="numbering_system_us_highway_container">
                <img id="first_main_us_highway_sign" src="The Routes of America_U.S. Highways_files/US_20.png" alt="US-20 Sign" 
                 width="200" height="200">
                <img id="second_main_us_highway_sign" src="The Routes of America_U.S. Highways_files/US_287.png" alt="US-287 Sign" 
                 width="200" height="200">
                <p>Much like the Interstate highways, the U.S. highways follow a grid numbering pattern, 
                   in which routes assigned odd-numbers run north-south and routes assigned even-numbers
                   run east-west, though routes assigned three-digit numbers can be either-or. However, 
                   some two-digit routes don't run in their general direction. Unlike the Interstate 
                   Highway Numbering System, the U.S. Highway Numbering System assigns lower odd numbers
                   in the east, higher odd numbers in the west, lower even numbers in the north, and 
                   higher even numbers in the south. The one- and two-digit U.S. highways are major 
                   routes, while three-digit U.S. highways are shorter spur routes from a main U.S. 
                   highway and just like Interstate highways, not all of them run in the same direction
                   as their parent U.S. highways.</p>

            <h2>Signage</h2>

                <p>U.S. Highways are typically displayed as large black rectangles with white shields 
                    displayed within them and their distinct route number displayed within the shield. 
                    Individual states around America manufactures their own U.S. highway signs, as 
                    they may use cut-out or rectangular designs, outline black outlines, and print the 
                    letters "US" above the numerals. One- and two-digit numbered shields feature the same
                    large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either 
                    use the same shield with a narrow font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield. 
                    Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a 
                    letter suffixed to the route number.</p>

                   routes in Pennsylvania, US-6N doesn't rejoin US-6 as its west end. Special routes 
                   are assigned lettered suffixes, like A for alternate and B for business.</p>

                <p>U.S highways were originally called auto trails from 1903-1926. Auto trail 
                   associations made the system of road marking haphazardous and ununiformed. In 1925,
                   the Joint Board on Interstate Highways worked to form a national numbering system
                   to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the
                   U.S. Department of Agriculture in November, 1925. The U.S. Highway system was 
                   approved on November 11, 1926.</p>

            <h3>Expansion</h3>
            <section class="container d-flex" id="history_expansion_us_highway_container">
                <p>Expansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the Interstate 
                   Highway System was developed under the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
                   After the national implementation of the Interstate Highway system, many U.S. 
                   highways bypassed or overlaid by or with Interstate highways have been removed from 
                   the system. In some places, where there are no nearby Interstate highways, the U.S. 
                   highways often remain as the most well-developed roads for long-distance travel. 
                   While the system's growth has slowed in recent decades, the U.S. Highway System 
                   remains in place to this day and new are are added to the system.</p>
